Have you ever get yourself waxed or imagine how would you feel having just the protective layer of your skin being pulled off? I am sure the pain would be worse for poor alligators and crocodiles who are skinned for the leather which is used to make bags, wallets, belts, shoes, jackets and much more. These crocodiles do not shed "Crocodile tears" while they are being poached instead they writhe in pain waiting to breathe their last.

Poster making is an important and integral part of Communication Design. In my assignment named 'Form and Communication', I had to choose a social issue and make a poster as a call against this prevailing issue. The social issue chosen by me was "The skinning of crocodiles for its leather by big fashion brands". Here are the pictures of the two posters made by me targeting the big fashion brands and urging them to refrain from skinning the alligators and crocodiles for mere accessories.
