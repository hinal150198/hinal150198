Biscuits, Breads, Rusk, Cakes, Beverages, Dairy products and what not. Britannia- The "Biscuit King" of India is a 126-years-old food product based industry. With more than 10 types of biscuits, 4 types of bread, 3 types of cheese and 6 types of cakes that Britannia produces it has been winning people's trust since it's beginning.

This assignment was about creating a Logotype for well known industries or companies. Logotype is a type of logo made up of name of the business or the company itself. The post involves various steps which lead to the final creation of the logotype for Britannia Industries Limited.


Step-1 (Mock-up 1)

Logo is an visual output of brand's ideology, ethos and motto. The entire brand identity has to come along in a logo. The picture above was the first mock-up created for the logotype. This logotype not only reflects Britannia as a brand, which manufactures biscuits by the letter denoted by a biscuit in letter 'B', but also represents the "think better" aspect of its tagline denoted by a rocket in the letter 'A'. This logotype also suggests that Britannia is a playful and kids-centric brand.

Step-2 (Mock-up 2)

The above logotypes were the second mock-ups created for this assignment. These logotypes reflects the corporate and professional identity of the brand. This logotype is also a reflection of the two main products namely biscuits and breads manufactured by this brand.

Step-3 (Final Logotype)

After much brain-storming, this was the final logo which was liked and approved by my facilitator and my classmates. Hope you like it too :). This logotype is based on the ideation that Britannia does not only have corporate identity but it also manufactures products for kids which are very healthy. The aspect of good health is also present in the brand's tagline "Eat Healthy, Think Better". The two wheat stalks in place of letter 'I' represents healthy wheat flour as an integral ingredient of the food products manufactured by Britannia. Being simplistic and minimalistic, it even helps portray the corporate identity of the brand.

Step-4

The final logo was created in the reverse background i.e. it was transformed into a black-and-white logotype for it's specific usage.
