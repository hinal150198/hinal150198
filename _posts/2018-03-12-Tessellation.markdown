Me: Let's Dance.

M.C. Escher: No, let's tessellate!

Maurits Cornelis Escher or commonly M. C. Escher, was a Dutch graphic artist who made mathematically inspired woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints. One of the many types of artworks that he is known for, Tessellation is one of them. Tessellation is an art of tessellating a surface which involves an arrangement of shapes closely fitted together, especially of polygons in a repeated pattern without gaps or overlapping. M.C. Escher is known as the father of modern tessellations.

In this assignment we had to create a tessellation for a particular context i.e. keeping in mind it's use.

Here is the picture of the stencil which I made to make my tessellation

This is the picture of the digital version of my final tessellation which can be used as a gift wrapping paper to wrap Christmas gifts.
